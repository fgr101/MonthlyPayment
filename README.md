**Language Lesson Payment Management System - README**

Overview:

This project is a simple payment management system for language lessons written in C. It allows users to generate payments, show monthly payment logs, save data, and perform other basic functions related to managing payments for language lessons.

**Features:**

**Generate Payment:** Users can generate payment details for language lessons based on the lesson mode (individual or group), number of hours, and whether a discount is applied.
**Show Monthly Payments Log:** This feature is not fully implemented in the current version of the program.
**Save Data:** Users can save payment details to a file for record-keeping purposes.
**Language Selection:** The program supports English, Spanish, and Portuguese languages, allowing users to choose their preferred language for interacting with the system.
**Discount Option**: Users can apply a discount to their payment, with the discount amount configurable through a constant in the code.
**Clear Screen Functionality:** The program includes a function to clear the console screen for better user experience.
